#Srcfetch

Srcfetch is a plugin for the text editor Atom. It works like this. For example, if you need a code snippet which performs *insertion sort*,then just type the following in the text editor.
```
insertion sort
```
Then select the text and press *Ctrl+Alt+O*. Then, the selected text will be replaced by the code snippet. This plugin uses Google and StackOverflow for searching code snippets.
